Welcome to the Clean Herbs project!

Here is how to set up the project on your own computer in 5 minutes.

REQUIREMENTS:
You must have XAMPP installed (or any other local server with PHP and MySQL).

STEP 1: SET UP THE FILES

Copy the entire cleanherbs folder from the pen drive.

Paste it into your XAMPP installation's htdocs folder.
(The final path should be C:\xampp\htdocs\cleanherbs)

STEP 2: SET UP THE DATABASE

Open your XAMPP Control Panel and Start both "Apache" and "MySQL".

Open your web browser and go to: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/

Click the "Import" tab at the top of the page.

Click the "Choose File" button.

Find and select the database_setup.sql file (which is inside the cleanherbs folder).

Scroll to the bottom of the Import page and click the "Go" button.

That's it! The database cleanherbs_db will be created, all tables will be set up, and the sample products will be inserted.

STEP 3: RUN THE PROJECT

You can now access the website by visiting:
http://localhost/cleanherbs/

To log in as an admin, you will first need to register a normal user and then change their is_admin status from 0 to 1 in the users table.
